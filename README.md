# KolmogorovArnoldNetworks.jl
# This is in very early stages
## If you are interested in becoming a maintainer, please open a PR!

KolmogorovArnoldNetworks.jl is a Julia library providing implementations of [Kolmogorov-Arnold neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19756). Implementation inspired by [Efficient KAN](https://github.com/Blealtan/efficient-kan).

Please feel free to contribute!

## TODO: Fix example.jl
Once that is working, this can be made an official package

## Installation (soon)

You can install KolmogorovArnoldNetworks.jl using the Julia package manager. From the Julia REPL, type `]` to enter the package manager mode, then run:

```julia
pkg> add KolmogorovArnoldNetworks
```
